## **R**eact **U**ser **IN**terface for **E**xpediated **D**evelopment
There's a few of these out there, but I decided to make my own since I use this commonly. In short, it's a no-hassle UI component set for React. Unlike some other React user interfaces I chose to not hard-code the styling into the components.
So this isn't inline-styled to bootstrap, or material. If your looking for those, go for [Elemental](https://github.com/elementalui/elemental) or [Material](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui).
Instead, I've chosen a simple css class based approach so you can do it yourself.
